# Tetris Project

This project is a personal challenge where I set out to recreate the classic Tetris game using only JavaScript / TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

The main premise was to develop the game without doing any online searches on how games are made or looking at how other engineers had done it in the past. The entire development was driven by my own logic and memory of the original Tetris game. It was a case of exploring, understanding, and resolving each problem in creating the mechanics of the game as they came up.

## My Experience

The game started with a matrix of elements and all the code in a single file. As I progressed in development and ideas about how to create different elements of the game became clearer, I started breaking down the code into smaller units. This resulted in cleaner, organized, and more understandable code.

There were times when I had to rethink certain ideas. On many occasions, I had to draw the movements of the figures in a notebook to better understand the logic and steps needed to implement the functionalities I wanted.

2. Enter the project directory:

## Project Scripts

The project includes the following scripts:

- `build`: compiles the project.
  Run with `npm run build`.

- `watch`: Runs the compiler in a watch mode, which auto-recompiles the code whenever it detects changes.
  Run with `npm run watch`.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- "glob": "^10.3.10"
- "lodash": "^4.17.21"
